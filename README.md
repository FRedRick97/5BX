# 5BX

5BX is a way to track a simple workout.  

Influenced by the 5BX system created in the 1950s by Dr. Bill Orban, and The Hacker's Diet by John Walker, although this project claims no affiliation with either.  



This app is a GitHub hosted page which is fully functional.  The page is designed specifically with mobile devices in mind.
